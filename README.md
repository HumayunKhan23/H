Hospital Data Processing in Stata

Overview
This Stata script automates the processing, cleaning, and consolidation of hospital data files spanning from 2017 to 2024. The script handles variations in file naming conventions, ensures data consistency, and appends datasets into a single master file. Additionally, it generates flags for identifying the first and last instances of hospitals in the dataset.

Data Import: Reads monthly hospital data CSV files.

Data Cleaning:
Handles inconsistencies in column names.
Converts providerid to string format.
Removes leading zeros from providerid.

Data Transformation:
Creates a year_month variable for each dataset.

Data Consolidation:
Combines all datasets into a single .dta file.

Flagging Instances:
first_instance: Flags the first appearance of a hospital after April 2017.
last_instance: Flags the last recorded appearance of a hospital.

📝 Script Explanation
1. Data Import Loop (2017–2020)
Iterates over each year (2017–2020) and month (1–12).
Handles specific exceptions for file naming inconsistencies (e.g., 2020-07 and 2020-10).

3. Data Import Loop (2021–2024)
Adjusts for newer file naming conventions from 2021–2024.

5. Appending Datasets
Appends selected monthly datasets into a single .dta file: Appended_Hospitals.dta.

7. Flagging Instances
Sorts data by providerid and year_month.

Flags:
first_instance: First hospital appearance after April 2017.
last_instance: Final recorded entry for a hospital.

💾 Output Files
Monthly Datasets: 2017_01.dta, 2020_07.dta, etc.
